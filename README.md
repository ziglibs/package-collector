# Package Collector

Collects packages from sevaral package indices and provides them to [zig.pm](https://zig.pm/).

## Package Indices

The following package indices are polled by this tool:

- [GitHub topic `zig-package`](https://github.com/topic/zig-package)
- [GitHub topic `zig-library`](https://github.com/topic/zig-library)
- [ziglibs/repository](https://github.com/ziglibs/repository)
- [Astrolabe](https://astrolabe.pm/)
- [Aquila.Red](https://aquila.red/)

If there are other package indices out there that aren't yet collected, please [add a new issue](https://github.com/ziglibs/package-collector/issues/new) for each of them.
